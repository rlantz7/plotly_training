    "# Python Basics\n",
    "From the [python.org executive summary](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/):\n",
    "> Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is a great way to write data science scripts because it combines code cells with markdown cells, making it possible to create reports that are dynamic, styled, and interacive.  Jupyter Notebooks (formerly IPython Notebooks) come as part of the Anaconda Distribution that includes lots of other great packages.  The Anaconda distribution is the easiest way to get started with data science in Python, and includes as part of the base distribution `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `numpy`."

    "## Basic variable types and operations\n",
    "There are categories of variable types that you can define names for, including strings (`str`), integers (`int`), floats (`float`), as well as collections includings lists and dictionaries (which we'll get into a little later).  All of these variables are objects that have methods associated with them out of the box.\n",
    "As with any programmning language, Python comes with certain functions baked in.  The way a function works (or even if it works at all) will depend on what type of object you're applying it to.  For instance below I'll define a few variables, and then try to do some stuff with them."

Objects can be of any type, are ordered, and can repeat elements.  A `tuple` is like a list, but, once created cannot be updated.  Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.  A dictionary (`dict`) is a key-value collection that is unordered and allows for by-name reference to the data contained in the value.  You can have nested lists and dictionaries. "

Python's syntax for this is pretty simple, and requires you to learn two things about it's interpreter.  First, the end of your conditional statement should end with a colon (:) character.  Second, all of the code that you want to execute should be on the lines that follow that colon, and end when you stop indenting the lines.  \n",

    "We can get a lot more fancy than merely dot plots though.  For instance, let's say I wanted a bubble chart.  In this case, I'm creating a trace for each region of the world.  I don't want to manually write each trace... that's prone to errors, and I'm lazy anyway.  Instead I'll create a function that returns a tuple of my `x` value, `y` value, `sz` size (that I want my bubble to be), and `tx` text (that I want to appear when I hover over the bubble).  Note that the division of labor between the `for` loop below and the `create_trace` function is kind of artibitrary.  It would have been cleaner, for instance, if my `create_trace` actually returned a `trace` object, and then all my `for` loop would do is append each `trace` to the `data` list."
